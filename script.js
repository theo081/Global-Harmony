  <h2>Welcome to Global Harmony</h2>
  <p>As an international student and music lover, Iâ€™ve traveled widely and met friends from many cultures. Iâ€™m fascinated by the unique and beautiful songs each country offersâ€”especially pop music, which, despite language and cultural barriers, feels universal and deeply relatable.</p>
  <p>Music has helped me connect cross-culturally, sparking my interest to explore, learn, and adapt to new cultures. American pop music, like J.B., Taylor Swift and Westlife, greatly influenced me back home and helped me improve my English.</p>
  <p>Through music, I learned about the U.S. lifestyle and culture even before arriving, making the transition easier. On this site, I share music from different cultures so you can experience firsthand how music transcends language, allowing us to feel and fall in love with diverse cultures.</p>
